# Overview

# What is Epilepsy

It's a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures.
The cause of epilepsy varies; there can be no cause or caused by brain injuries, infection, tumors, genetics, etc. Diagnosing epilepsy involves:  neurological examination, and often  EEG recordings to detect abnormal brain activity during or between seizures. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. 

EEG signals record the electrical activity of the brain using EEG electrodes placed on the scalp. 
Doctors, neuroscientists, and biomedical engineers usually receive training for years to understand and extract meaningful information from EEG data. 
Even in these cases, the raw recorded data needs to be processed before specialists look at it.
From a computational point of view, the raw EEG signal is simply a discrete-time multivariate time-series. (usually with multiple dimensions), which is how we evaluate it.

# Business Understanding

AI and machine learning tools are the perfect companion to automate, extend, and improve electroencephalogram (EEG) scan interpretation from medical professionals. 
It takes years of training to accurately be able to interpret these brain scans and we believe machine learning can make this process easier for physicians to diagnose patients with severe brain conditions, like epilepsy. 
Some of our current stakeholders who have funded this project, are Columbia University, and Mount Sinai Department of Neurology
